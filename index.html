<style>Style .css allows you to modify the visual appearance of a website or a webpage (whichever term you are comfortable with). It can be changed through contant properties such as the height, the margin, width, and most importantly the color. Though all of this comes of easy as they are selected with the HTML elements that are keyed in through the class attribute. Though in most cases not many get to use it as much as since it does not allow one to make specified changed for but most of the time it does. For my website i shall go through the content i have been required to go through and then make sure with every step of the way I keep on pushing my commits to github and making sure that my progress does not remain stagnant. In most cases due to internet issues or power, I may be unable to update my commits on github hence that would halt my progress. In other stories I just found out that this guy Andrew decided to go to AKAM, suprisingly enough my dad told me this exactly a week before we open school and to my surprise a neigbor confirms my doubts. Looking at the way this has all been laid out. This in sum is quite scary yet I feel I should not be worried about it aas much but something still decides to disturb me based on my past expreience with his future classmate (coming next week) and most importantly my past with him. He seems to be the kind of a guy who is kind and nurtured well with an appropriate upbringing meaning that his ,manners are appropriate this man is basically the unrealized version of me. But now this one is taking it to another level because I remember him syaing that he was not really goin to move to AKAM but now that it is confirmed I am completely shocked and struck because now he will speak with the guy that I know but it will also mean that I mean he has already doen this without a doubt in my mind tell others of who I was back then, How is used to act back then. Basically my character.All of this is basically about how this huy has been doing everything to become a better person but I my friend am just starting. At some point I know which is very very close shall be extremely confident and successful with prayer and continous humbleness will show and know what type of a guy I really am or Who I have always been.</style>
